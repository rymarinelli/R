# Time Series Analysis of Baseball Player Salaries

## Concept
<h5> Use ARDL model to estimate how player's performance and the the performance of the team affect salaries.</h5>
<h5> Data is stationary and LM tests suggest ARCH effects. Newey West Standard errors are applied to correct for it </h5>

## Data
<h5>The data is from the Lahman dataset and runs from 1985-2016.</h5> 
<h5> CPI index for salary normalization is from FRED </h5>

## Other Info on Repo
<h5> Data present in this repo has been added to make results reproduceable. The R markdown file in this directory is the final model and is reflected in the powerpoint saved in this directory as well. 
 </h5> 

## Event Info
<h5>Analysis is being conducted as part of a submission to give a poster talk with the University of Connecticut
Deadline - Oct 2nd, 2020
