This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r include =FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
```

```{r include =FALSE}
df <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rymarinelli/R/master/Baseball%20Analysis/Data_Viz.csv')
df <- df %>% data.frame()
df %>% colnames()
cluster <- df %>% select(teamID,adjusted_salary,batting_Average,homerun_Average, RBI)
cluster <- cluster %>% group_by(teamID) %>% summarise(adjusted_salary = mean(adjusted_salary), batting_Average = mean(batting_Average)*100, homerun_Average = mean(homerun_Average), RBI = mean(RBI))

```


```{r include =FALSE}
names <- cluster$teamID
cluster <- unique(cluster)
cluster <- cluster %>% as.matrix()
rownames(cluster) <- make.names(names, unique=TRUE)
cluster <- cluster %>% data.frame()
cluster$teamID<- NULL
```

```{r include =FALSE}
cluster$adjusted_salary <- cluster$adjusted_salary %>% as.numeric()
cluster$batting_Average <- cluster$batting_Average  %>% as.numeric()
cluster$homerun_Average <- cluster$homerun_Average  %>% as.numeric()
cluster$RBI <- cluster$RBI %>% as.numeric()
```

<h5>
Clustering Algorithm is using RBI, batting average, average number of homeruns and salary to group teams.
The goal in part of this analysis is to determine which teams are using their funds most effectively. 
</h5>
```{r echo=FALSE}
cluster <- scale(cluster)
fviz_nbclust(cluster, kmeans, method = "silhouette")
```

```{r include =FALSE}
k2 <- kmeans(cluster, centers = 5, nstart = 25)
cluster.2 <- fviz_cluster(k2, data = cluster, labelsize = 10)
```

<h5>
In parition clustering, K-Means is grouping like team teams based on batting performance and salary of their players. 
. The data suggested that a natural partion would be 5 different grouping. It seems like New York is an outlier which is not suprising.
</h5>
```{r echo = F}
cluster.2
```

```{r include = FALSE}
d <- dist(cluster, method = "euclidean")

m <- c( "average", "single", "complete", "ward")
names(m) <- c( "average", "single", "complete", "h4 ward")

# function to compute coefficient
ac <- function(x) {
  agnes(d, method = x)$ac
}

map_dbl(m, ac)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
hc3 <- agnes(cluster, method = "ward")
h3 <-pltree(hc3, cex = 0.6, hang = -1, main = "Baseball Team Batting Ability")
```
<h5>
In hierarchial clustering, we can observe the relationships a bit more clearly. 
It appears PHI is most similar to San Diego's team which is interesting
</h5>
```{r echo=FALSE}
hc3 <- agnes(cluster, method = "ward")
h3 <-pltree(hc3, cex = 0.6, hang = -1, main = "Baseball Team Batting Ability")
rect.hclust(hc3, k = 4, border = 2:5)
```
